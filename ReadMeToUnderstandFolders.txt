The OpenVoiceNav folder consists of basically 3 important folders.
1- OpenVoiceNavApp ( this is the Pyroute library implementation of Routing tool developed by Aloysius Prayitno on Google Apps Engine-not part of GSoC'09).
2- OSMPrototypes ( this is a collection of Experiments done during 1st phase of GSoC'09 and later, which was eventually improved to create polished application - Eurotriptalk )
3- Eurotripalk ( this is final polished application )
p.s. Rest file and folders belong to openvoicenavapp
