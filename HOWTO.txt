In some directory in command line

or use some other title instead of openvoicnav

change to that directory, copy some files there, use command
    hg st
to see what files changed (M), new (?), were added (A)

add new files with
    hg add

commit with a message
    hg ci -m "in this commit I added this and that"

push to the server
    hg push
you'll need your password for googlecode, that can be found at

patterns to ignore can be written to .hgignore, at the moment all files with extension .zip are ignored

There are visual clients for Mercurial, but I would recommend understanding it with command line first.
